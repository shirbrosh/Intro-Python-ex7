=  Description: =
==================

print_to_n- A function that prints each number from 1 to n, if given a number n
    lower from 1 the function wont print anything.
print_reversed- A function that prints each number from n to 1, if given a number n
    lower from 1 the function wont print anything.
has_divisor_smaller_than- A function that checks if the input n has a divider (different from 1)
    smaller from the input i- this function will be used in the next function:
is_prime- A function that returns True if the input n is prime or False otherwise.
factorial- A function that calculate factorial of the number n- this function will be used
    in the next function:
exp_n_x- A function that calculate the exponent amount of n and x.
play_hanoi- A function that plays the 'hanoi tower' game and wins.
print_sequences- A function that receives a list of chars and prints every combination of
    strings in length n containing the chars from the list.
print_no_repetition_sequences- A function that receives a list of chars and prints every
    combination of strings in length n containing the chars from the list without repetition.
parentheses_string - A function that receives n- number of parentheses pairs and adds to a
    list every legal combination of n pairs, legal combination means that each
    open parentheses have a close parentheses- this function will be used in the next function:
parentheses- A function that receives n- number of parentheses pairs, creates a new
    empty list and adds to the list all the legal parentheses combination using
    the function parentheses_string and returns the list.
up_and_right- A function that receives the number of steps allowed right and left and
    print every legal combinations of steps to preform, legal combination means
    only n times right and k times left.
flood_fill- A function that receives an image and a start coordinate and changes
    every other coordinate that can be reached from the start (by moving only
    up, down, right and left) from "." to "*".

Run time analysis-
    1.is prime- this function calls a recursive function that runs from (sqrt(n)+1) down
        to n<=2 each run runs on -1 numbers which is why the run time will be O(sqrt(n)).
    2.print_no_repetition_sequences- this function has a for loop that runs on the char_list
        length and then operates a recursion n times, which means for each length we run n times
        which is why the run time will be O(len^n).
    3.flood_fill- worse case is that the matrix is empty (filled only with ".") in this case
    will have to change every cell to "*", if the matrix's size is n*n then the function will
    make O(n*n)=O(n^2).
